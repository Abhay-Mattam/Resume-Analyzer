# Resume-Analyzer


The AI-Based Resume Analyzer is a Python-driven web application designed to streamline the process of analyzing resumes. Using advanced text extraction techniques and natural language processing (NLP), this tool automates the task of parsing PDF resumes, providing valuable insights about a candidateâ€™s qualifications, skills, and experience. The project combines several Python libraries like Flask, PyPDF2, and spaCy to create a seamless user experience.

 Key Features:
1. PDF Resume Upload: Users can upload their resumes in PDF format via a simple and intuitive web interface.
2. Text Extraction: The system extracts text from the uploaded PDF using the PyPDF2 library, ensuring accuracy in processing document content.
3. NLP-Powered Analysis: The extracted text is analysed using spaCy, a powerful NLP library, to identify key information such as skills, experience, education, and contact details.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The web application, built using Flask, provides a clean and minimalistic user interface for easy navigation and interaction.
5. Results Display: Once the resume is analysed, the extracted information is displayed in a formatted manner on the results page, giving the user insight into their resume content.
6. Error Handling: The system includes robust error handling to manage issues like incorrect file uploads or unreadable PDFs, providing feedback to the user.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for text extraction and analysis.
Flask: A lightweight web framework that powers the web interface of the project.
PyPDF2: A library used to extract text from PDF files.
spaCy: An NLP library used to analyze the text content of resumes.
HTML/CSS: For designing the frontend interface where users interact with the application.

Workflow:
1. Users access the web application and upload their PDF resume.
2. The system processes the uploaded file, extracting text content from the PDF.
3. The extracted text is analyzed using NLP to identify key sections like education, work experience, and skills.
4. The analyzed data is presented to the user in a clean format on a results page, providing useful insights for resume improvement.

Use Cases:
HR Professionals: Automate resume screening by quickly extracting and reviewing key details.
Developers: Build upon the framework by adding custom features such as keyword matching for specific job roles or advanced skill analysis.

This project offers a strong foundation for AI-based document analysis and can be further extended to include features like scoring resumes based on job descriptions, providing resume improvement suggestions, and more.
